# Work Day Calender 1.0

This work day calendar is written with BootStrap, JQuery and Moment.js to the style and specifications that were requested by the client, who has, shall we say, Tastes. Whether those Tastes are good or bad are not for us, the humble coder to judge, only to cater to, as best our abilities allow us to, ignoring our own involuntary twitchy eyes and trying to spare our molars convulsive grinding.

So, per the client's Tastes, we had a style sheet. With, um, Colors. That we implemented per the clients Tastes. The current hour is highlighted with a cranberry color that the client thought would look good next to a somehow neon-drab green, which represents future hours. The past is represented by grey, which is a relief, though it has the same brightness value as the red and green, which might be a problem for colorblind people and i was kind of assuming the client was colorblind by the colors they picked, but picked them they did, so no judgement at all, just gently reminding anyone reading this that i am catering to what i keep somehow referring to (despite increasing twitches) as the client's Taste.

Also per client's Taste, which i am resolutely not putting in quotation marks, we are using JQuery, MomentJS, and Bootstrap. Which the client likes. They don't think that Bootstrap is to the teens what shoulder pads were to the late 80s. They don't think that jQuery is like putting galoshes over perfectly nice shoes while wearing a nice outfit and then pretending that nothing is wrong. And, the client has no issue with the fact that Moment JS's own website practically begs you to use anything else. So these are all cool. Because of the client's Tastes. Which i am capitalizing, because, honestly.

Per the client's request and styling, the non-functional title at the top is huge, typographically dripping over a vague description of the functionality. In the same font-size and -weight as the description is today's date. In the font of the client's choosing. 

Upon clicking on the time slots, the user can enter tasks to do for the day, which will be saved to local storage, in case they refresh the page. I am hoping that the client likes it.
